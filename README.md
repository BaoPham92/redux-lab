## Part I: Redux Shopping Cart

Incorporating Redux into your React App can be a challenging process so it's important to take time to understand how the code works. Go through the [Shopping Cart](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/react-redux-shopping-cart) walkthrough.

## Part II: Redux Todo App

Once you have completed the Shopping Cart walkthrough, use the same methodology to create a Todo app (i.e., an app that maintains a todo list).

What exactly the application looks like is up to you, but try to implement the following features that were not featured in the Shopping Cart walkthrough...

- The user should be able to see two lists: one of incomplete todos and one of complete todos
- The user should be able to delete a todo so that it is no longer visible in the app
